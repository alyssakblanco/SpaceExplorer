<b>How to play:</b> <br/>
Using the WASD keys to move and Spacebar to shoot, play as a rocket traveling through our solar system while avoiding asteroids and learning fun facts along the way. 

<b>How to win:</b> <br/>
There is no end, the goal is to make it as far as possible without losing your lives.

<b>How to lose:</b> <br/>
Get hit by asteroids 3 times. <br/>
(There are power-ups to earn a life back)

<b>How to score:</b> <br/>
Score is based on your distance from the Sun ( the start of the game ) in miles.

<b>Important Files:</b> <br/>
Every file under the Scripts directory besides Fade and Initiate were created by me for this game.
<br/>
<b>LevelProgression</b> - This file is how I keep track of when to move on to the next level. The length of each level is based on the actual distance between each planet. Included in this file are commented out variables to make the levels shorter so you can play through the whole game quickly. (Denoted by the comments, "uncomment for quick testing of levels")
<br/>
Other than that, each file in this directory is named after it's function.
